## Purcell Tech Test

Here's my submission for the tech test to find a missing number in an input array.

I've had a bit of fun adding multiple solutions, and a micro "test suite" to compare their performance.

I must note that the `Xor` solution I did not derive myself, tho I do understand it and can walk you through it if needs be.

### Output
